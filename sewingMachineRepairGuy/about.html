            <h2>How We Got Started</h2>
            <p>Hi! I’m Bob, a husband, dad, US Navy veteran, computer guru, and if it breaks I can fix it! I have been in the computer/printer repair business  since 1990, and electronics since my Navy days. Several  years ago, I started thinking about the future, and  retirement from my career. I have serviced many kinds  of computers, printers, electronics in general, built things, remodeled houses and RVs, rebuilt automobile engines, and thought maybe it might be fun to try something new. Printers have ink, sewing machines have needles so they’re cousins, right? You’d be surprised how comparable they are!
                <br> 
                Since my wife of 48 years has been a sewing maniac most of that time, making most of our clothes, costumes, formals, quilts, even upholstering furniture, she has accumulated several high-end machines. I tinkered with them here and there. Though they didn’t stump me, I  thought it might be a good idea to have some formal training so I wasn’t missing anything important.
                <br> 
                As the story goes, I attended the Sewing Machine Institute in Texas, and became officially certified to repair all kinds of sewing machines. As a plus, we even had a course in vacuum cleaners! I’ve been at it for a few years, but it’s time to officially get down to business!
                <br> 
                I look forward to serving you, keeping your machines up and running…”keeping you in stitches”!
