            <h2>How We Got Started</h2>
            <p>Hi! I’m Bob, a husband, dad, US Navy veteran, computer guru,
                <br> and if it breaks I can fix it!
                <br> I have been in the computer/printer repair business 
                <br> since 1990, and electronics since my Navy days. Several 
                <br> years ago, I started thinking about the future, and 
                <br> retirement from my career. I have serviced many kinds 
                <br> of computers, printers, electronics in general, built
                <br> things, remodeled houses and RVs, rebuilt automobile
                <br> engines, and thought maybe it might be fun to try
                <br> something new. Printers have ink, sewing machines have
                <br> needles so they’re cousins, right? You’d be surprised
                <br> how comparable they are!
                <br>
                <br> Since my wife of 48 years has been a sewing maniac most
                <br> of that time, making most of our clothes, costumes,
                <br> formals, quilts, even upholstering furniture, she has
                <br> accumulated several high-end machines. I tinkered with
                <br> them here and there. Though they didn’t stump me, I 
                <br> thought it might be a good idea to have some formal
                <br> training so I wasn’t missing anything important.
                <br>
                <br> As the story goes, I attended the Sewing Machine
                <br> Institute in Texas, and became officially certified
                <br> to repair all kinds of sewing machines. As a plus, we
                <br> even had a course in vacuum cleaners! I’ve been at it
                <br> for a few years, but it’s time to officially get down
                <br> to business!
                <br>
                <br> I look forward to serving you, keeping your machines up
                <br> and running…”keeping you in stitches”!
