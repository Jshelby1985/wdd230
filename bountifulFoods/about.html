        <h1 class="label">How We Started!</h1>
        
        <p>
                Bountiful Foods was born when a nine year old was selling ice cold lemonade in the front yard on a hot California day. Instead of 
            selling watered down powdered lemonade, it was squeezed fresh, and mixed just right. After the first day, it was decided that other
            flavors needed to be offered, and there began the drive to develop the best mixed fruit and vegetable drinks around. 
            This passion for creating wonderful drink combinations continued through college where drinks would be sold during campus events.
            Finally in 2012 the first "food truck" was built allowing Bountiful Foods to reach more people along the SoCal coast line. It was 
            quickly recognized that one truck would not be enough so we built two more. We now have three state of the art drink vending trucks 
            and a store front location in Carlsbad California.

        <h1 class="label">What We Do!</h1>
        <p>
            We specialize in mixed smoothies/juices and fresh fruit/vegetable trays. You can either choose one of our favorite combinations,
            or choose the ingredients your self and create your own. You can now, through this site on the "Fresh" page, select your ingredients
            and create your own drink or tray. You will be asked to select a pick up location which allows you to select any of our trucks or our
            store front location. Once you submit your order, it will be available for pick up in ten (10) to fifteen (15) minutes at the location
            of your choice. (Please recognize that some time periods are more busy than others and could create some delay in your order.)
