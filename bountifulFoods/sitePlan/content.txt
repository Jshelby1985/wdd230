    4) Social media links (at least three) (no account necessary).

        3) the humidity, and
        4) a three(3) day temperature forecast.

    1) The form requires the following items from the user:
        1) first name,
        2) email,
        3) phone number,

        2) the order date, and
        3) the total amount of carbohydrates, protein, fat, sugar, and calories based upon the three fruit choices selected on the form.
