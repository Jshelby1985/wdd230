CONTENT

1)ðŸ“„ The Home page is a contemporary, exciting landing page providing images of fruit and produce including specialty fruit drinks

    1) Readily available navigation and business contact information.
    2) Summary information about any coastal area or areas in the southern California coast of your choosing.
    3) A call to action to make your own fruit drink mix. This link can link to the ðŸ“„Fresh page.
    4) Social media links (at least three) (no account necessary).
    5) The weather card(s) must summarize the current weather conditions for Carlsbad. Use the OpenWeatherMap APIs (weather, forecast/daily)
       and include:
        1) the current temperature,
        2) the condition description,
        3) the humidity, and
        4) a three(3) day temperature forecast.
    6) Include an information card about the total number of specialty drinks that the current user has submitted from the Fresh page form. 
       This information should just be stored locally, with the user's agent (in their browser).

2)ðŸ“„ The Fresh page contains a form that allows the user to build their own specialty drink.
    1) The form requires the following items from the user:
        1) first name,
        2) email,
        3) phone number,
        4) three (3) select element inputs that are populated with the available fruit to put into a drink.
            ~ Populate all three select elements with all of the available fruits.
            ~ Available fruit options must only come from this JSON data source for full credit consideration: Fruit DataLinks to an 
              external site.
        5) and, include an area that allows them to add special instructions, if needed.

    2) Do NOT send the form to a new page upon form submission. Instead, use a JavaScript event handler to produce a formatted output
    area on this same page showing:
        1) the input values of the order (7 inputs = first name, email, phone, three selected fruits, and special instructions),
        2) the order date, and
        3) the total amount of carbohydrates, protein, fat, sugar, and calories based upon the three fruit choices selected on the form.
           The data source provides that information per fruit.

3) ðŸ“„ The About Us page provides historical information about the company and area plus contact information, and a Google Map and other
      relevant content.
4) If necessary, include a resource/attribution page that references outside content as a link in the footer.
